## Handlers
Handlers are code executed by the workflow process.  They perform actions in workflows. Examples of some actions are CRUD (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) operations as well as performing loops, echoing values, and transforming data. The body of all of the workflows are made of of Handler "nodes" and connectors.

Workflow developers work with handlers extensively. Very experienced workflow developers often learn to create their own handlers, as they find they may want to tweak the actions taken in existing handlers.
